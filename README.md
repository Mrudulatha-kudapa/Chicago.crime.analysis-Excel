# Data-Analysis-Excel
Objective:
Build a comprehensive and automated E-Commerce Dashboard in Excel that summarizes critical sales and profitability metrics, providing insights into the overall business performance. The dashboard will use aggregate functions to track total sales, profits, order quantity, and average profit margin, empowering stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

Goals:

Sum of Sales:
Calculate and display the total revenue generated from all orders, allowing for easy comparison across time periods (daily, monthly, yearly).

Sum of Profit per Order:
Track the total profit made from all orders by calculating the difference between sales revenue and costs, helping to assess business profitability.

Sum of Order Quantity:
Display the total number of units sold across all orders, identifying trends in product demand and customer purchasing patterns.

Average Profit Margin:
Calculate the average profit margin (percentage) by dividing the total profit by the total sales revenue. This will help assess the overall profitability of each sale.
